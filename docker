Docker with XFS is an excellent combination:
Docker benefits with XFS:

Docker's overlay2 storage driver works great with XFS
Handles many container layers efficiently
Better performance with image pulls/builds (lots of metadata operations)
Excellent for Docker volumes with databases (PostgreSQL, etc.)
Handles the constant file creation/deletion from container churn very well
XFS's parallel I/O shines when running multiple containers

# After installation, before installing Docker:
sudo mkdir -p /home/docker
sudo ln -s /home/docker /var/lib/docker

# Then install Docker
sudo zypper install docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

Alternative (even simpler):
If you want to do it after Docker is already installed:
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo mv /var/lib/docker /home/docker
sudo ln -s /home/docker /var/lib/docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Run docker without sudo
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
